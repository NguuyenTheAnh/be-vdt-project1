1. **Repository Setup**
   - Create 3 new Spring Boot projects
   - Configure basic database connections
   - Setup Docker compose for local development

2. **Database Preparation**
   - Create separate databases for each service
   - Migrate core tables to respective databases

### Hour 3-4: Authentication Service (11:00 AM - 1:00 PM)
1. **Extract Authentication Logic**
   - Move JWT authentication components
   - Basic user management endpoints
   - Simple role-based access control

### Hour 5-6: Loan Service (2:00 PM - 4:00 PM)

   - Deployment validation

## Simplified Technical Implementation

### Database Strategy
**Approach**: Simple database separation (no complex patterns)

1. **Quick Data Separation**:
   - Copy relevant tables to each service database
   - Use foreign key references where needed initially
   - Plan future data consistency improvements

### Inter-Service Communication
1. **REST APIs Only**: Simple HTTP calls between services
2. **No Message Queues**: Direct API calls for immediate results
3. **Basic Error Handling**: Simple retry mechanisms

### Security Architecture
1. **Shared JWT Secret**: All services validate tokens independently
2. **No API Gateway**: Direct service-to-service calls
3. **Basic Security**: Standard Spring Security configurations

### Data Migration Strategy
1. **Dual Write Pattern**: Write to both old and new systems
2. **Event Sourcing**: Replay events to new services
3. **Bulk Migration**: Offline migration with downtime windows
4. **Validation**: Data consistency checks and reconciliation

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Containerization**: Docker containers for all services
2. **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container management
3. **CI/CD**: Jenkins/GitLab CI with automated testing
4. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Data Consistency**: Implement compensation patterns
2. **Network Latency**: Use caching and async patterns
3. **Service Availability**: Circuit breakers and bulkhead isolation
4. **Transaction Management**: Saga pattern implementation

## Risk Management & Contingency

### Quick Rollback Plan
1. **Database Snapshots**: Take snapshots before starting migration
2. **Original Monolith**: Keep running as backup
3. **DNS/Load Balancer**: Quick switch back to monolith if needed
4. **Time Limit**: If 6 PM deadline approaches, rollback immediately

### Success Metrics for One Day

### Technical Metrics
- All 3 services: Running and responding
- Basic functionality: Authentication, loan creation, file upload working
- Data integrity: No data loss during migration
- Performance: Acceptable response times (under 2 seconds)

### Business Metrics
- Core workflows: Users can login and create loan applications
- File operations: Document upload/download functional
- System stability: No crashes during basic operations

## Resource Requirements

**Duration**: 8 hours (1 working day)
**Team Structure**:
- 2-3 Senior Backend Developers
- 1 DevOps/Infrastructure person
- 1 QA/Testing person

**Prerequisites**:
- Docker and containerization knowledge
- Spring Boot expertise
- Database management skills
- Basic microservices understanding

## Next Steps

1. **Day -1**: Team preparation and tool setup
2. **Day 0 (9:00 AM)**: Start infrastructure setup
3. **Day 0 (6:00 PM)**: Complete migration or rollback
4. **Day +1**: Stabilization and documentation
5. **Week +1**: Performance optimization and monitoring setup

## Conclusion

This one-day migration plan provides a rapid path to microservices architecture while maintaining system functionality. The simplified approach focuses on immediate benefits without complex distributed system patterns that can be added later as the system evolves.

This migration plan provides a structured approach to transform the monolithic loan management system into a scalable microservices architecture. The phased approach minimizes risk while delivering incremental value. Success depends on strong team coordination, robust testing, and careful attention to data consistency and service communication patterns.
